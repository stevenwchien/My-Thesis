\chapter{Next Steps and Future Work}
\label{ch4}

For our future steps, we would like to further classify threshold schemes of the form $((t,n,2))$, and see if our formulation reveals any further insight. After this, we would like to see if we can generalize to $((t,n,k))$ schemes, and hopefully prove properties about these schemes. The ultimate goal would be to fully classify the realizability of $((t,n,k))$ threhsold schemes.
