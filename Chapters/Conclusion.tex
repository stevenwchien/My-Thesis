\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{conclusion}

In this thesis, we have shown an implementation for a quantum threshold scheme that uses multiple copies of a quantum secret. Using an approach where we take the union of valid access structures, we are able to implement schemes that would otherwise not be realizable in a normal construction. With just one copy, the best that we can implement are schemes of the form $((t,2t-1))$. Using multiple copies, we were able to construct an implementation for schemes of the form $((t,2t-1+k,k))$, and show that these are the best that we can do using our strategy.

In our analysis, we restricted our discussion to just quantum threshold schemes. One possible avenue of future research would be to attempt to further classify the kinds of access structures that could be implemented using a union of access structures approach. Another avenue would be to experiment with strategies that deal more closely with the quantum nature of the information with which we are working. These strategies might include using quantum entanglement or constructing quantum circuits to create novel schemes.
