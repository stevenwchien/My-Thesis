\chapter*{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this thesis, we have shown an implementation for a quantum secret sharing scheme that uses multiple copies of a quantum secret. Using an approach where we take the union of valid access structures, we were able to implement schemes that would otherwise not be realizable in a normal construction. In general, we can only implement schemes of the form $((t,2t-1))$. We were able to describe an implementation for schemes of the form $((t,2t-1+k,k))$, and show that these are the best that we can do with our strategy.

By restricting our study to threshold schemes, we were able to prove more rigorous results and provide closed-form solutions for specific questions. One possible avenue of future research would be to attempt to further classify the kinds of access structures that could be implemented using a union of access structures approach. Another avenue would be to experiment with strategies that deal more closely with the quantum nature of the information with which we are working. These strategies might include using quantum entanglement or constructing quantum circuits. We could use these approaches and take advantage of the fact that we have access to multiple copies of the quantum state. Thank you for reading.
