We propose a conception of minimal maximal quantum access structure and obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for minimal maximal quantum access structure, which shows the relationship between the number of minimal authorized sets and that of the players. Moreover, we investigate the construction of efficient quantum secret schemes by using these techniques, a decomposition and minimal maximal quantum access structure. A major advantage of these techniques is that it allows us to construct a method to realize a general quantum access structure. For these quantum access structures, we present two quantum secret schemes via the idea of concatenation or a decomposition of a quantum access structure. As a consequence, the application of these techniques allow us to save more quantum shares and reduce more cost than the existing scheme.},

We show that the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum "no-cloning theorem", which requires that n {\textless} 2k, and, in all such cases, we give an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) threshold scheme. We also explore similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k {\textless}= n {\textless} 2k-1 then any ((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state.},

We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS), where access structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is permissible, provided some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show that no more than \${\textbackslash}lambda-1\$ withheld shares are required, where \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ is the minimum number of \{{\textbackslash}em partially linked classes\} among the authorized sets for the QSS. This is useful in QSS schemes where the share dealer is honest by definition and is equivalent to a secret reconstructor.

In particular we show that in order to transmit n qubits privately, 2n bits of shared private key are necessary and sufficient. This result may be viewed as the quantum analogue of the classical one-time pad encryption scheme. From the point of view of the eavesdropper, this encryption process can be seen as a randomization of the original state. We thus also obtain strict bounds on the amount of entropy necessary for randomizing n qubits.},

Threshold schemes, however, can only handle a small fraction of the secret sharing functions which we may wish to form. For example, if it is desirable to divide a secret among four participants A, B. C, and D in such a way that either A together with B can reconstruct the secret or C together with D can reconstruct the secret, then threshold schemes (even with weighting) are provably insufficient.This paper will present general methods for constructing secret sharing schemes for any given secret sharing function. There is a natural correspondence between the set of “generalized” secret sharing functions and the set of monotone functions, and tools developed for simplifying the latter set can be applied equally well to the former set.},

	abstract = {Quantum secret sharing is a procedure for sharing a secret among a number of participants such that only certain subsets of participants can collaboratively reconstruct it, which are called authorized sets. The quantum access structure of a secret sharing is a family of all authorized sets. Firstly, in this paper, we propose the concept of decomposition of quantum access structure to design a quantum secret sharing scheme. Secondly, based on a maximal quantum access structure (MQAS) [D. Gottesman, Phys. Rev. A 61, 042311 (2000)], we propose an algorithm to improve a MQAS and obtain an improved maximal quantum access structure (IMQAS). Then, we present a suﬃcient and necessary condition about IMQAS, which shows the relationship between the minimal authorized sets and the players. In accordance with properties, we construct an eﬃcient quantum secret sharing scheme with a decomposition and IMQAS. A major advantage of these techniques is that it allows us to construct a method to realize a general quantum access structure. Finally, we present two kinds of quantum secret sharing schemes via the thought of concatenation or a decomposition of quantum access structure. As a consequence, we ﬁnd that the application of these techniques allows us to save more quantum shares and reduces more cost than the existing scheme.},

Besides, the scheme provides a veriﬁcation mechanism which employs an additional qudit to detect cheats and eavesdropping during secret reconstruction and allows a participant to use the share repeatedly. Analyses show that the proposed scheme is resistant to typical attacks. Moreover, the scheme is scalable in participant number and easier to realize compared to related schemes. More generally, our scheme also presents a generic method to construct new (t, n) threshold QSS schemes based on d-level quantum system from other classical threshold secret sharing.},
