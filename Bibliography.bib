From the viewpoint of application, this places an unnatural constraint on secret sharing. We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS), where access structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is permissible, provided some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show that no more than \${\textbackslash}lambda-1\$ withheld shares are required, where \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ is the minimum number of \{{\textbackslash}em partially linked classes\} among the authorized sets for the QSS. This is useful in QSS schemes where the share dealer is honest by definition and is equivalent to a secret reconstructor. Our result means that such applications of QSS need not be thwarted by the no-cloning theorem.},

Secret sharing schemes have always played a very important role for cryptographic applications and in the construction of higher level cryptographic primitives and protocols. In this paper we investigate the construction of efficient secret sharing schemes by using a technique called hypergraph decomposition, extending in a non-trivial way the previously studied graph decomposition techniques. A major advantage of hypergraph decomposition is that it applies to any access structure, rather than only structures representable as graphs. As a consequence, the application of this technique allows us to obtain secret sharing schemes for several classes of access structures (such as hyperpaths, hypercycles, hyperstars and acyclic hypergraphs) with improved efficiency over previous results. Specifically, for these access structures, we present secret sharing schemes that achieve optimal information rate. Moreover, with respect to the average information rate, our schemes improve on previously known ones. In the course of the formulation of the hypergraph decomposition technique, we also obtain an elementary characterization of the ideal access structures among the hyperstars, which is of independent interest.},
